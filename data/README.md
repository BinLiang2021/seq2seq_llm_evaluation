This folder is a placeholder where you should place your input data (donwloaded following the instructions in the 
main README.md) and the output data (generated using the code). We do not store data on this git repo, except for the
human and GPT-4 annotation results, both in individual and aggregate form. This is to make
reproduction of our tables easier. The full datasets and models' outputs used for automatic metrics evaluation are not copied here.
