Horrific: This is the man who was bitten by a shark on the right side of his head as well as his back and torso . The victim, who has not been identified, was airlifted to St Mary's Medical Center's trauma unit. An update on his condition wasn't immediately available. The man had a cobia fish and sling-type spears aboard the boat, where he was fishing with a man and a woman, who both spoke Spanish. 'He was bleeding quite a bit,' witness Peter Pinello told WPBF. 'It looks like a shark had gotten him in the torso. You could see his wetsuit was embedded in it, and it looked like it took a good chunk of it out.' The man was spearfishing off Jupiter Inlet when he was bitten, according to ABC affiliate WPBF-TVin West Palm Beach. Pinello told WPBF he saw the victim when he was being brought back to shore. Palm Beach County Fire Rescue Battalion Chief John Vanek told WPBF that the victim was bitten on the head but was conscious when he was flown to the hospital. Bull sharks are common near the coast, particularly in Florida, with a preference for water less than 100 feet deeo. They target their prey in murky water where they are not easily visible.

But there's something we never knew about Bobby Drake, aka Iceman of the X-Men. Wednesday's issue of \"All-New X-Men\" No. 40 reveals the truth: Bobby is gay. \"There are thousands if not millions of stories of people who, for many different reasons, felt the need to hide their sexuality,\" Brian Michael Bendis, who wrote the issue, said in a statement to CNN. \"The X-Men, with the conceit of time travel, give us a fascinating platform in which to examine such personal journeys. This is just the first little chapter of a much larger story that will be told.\" Iceman's outing happens in an unusual manner. In the \"All-New X-Men\" storyline, members of the X-Men team travel to the past, as younger versions of themselves. Mind-reading mutant Jean Grey (also an X-Men original) asks Bobby why he calls women \"hot,\" when she knows he is gay. In comic book pages provided to CNN, Bobby doesn't immediately acknowledge that she is telling the truth. The character of Iceman is perhaps best known for his appearances in many of the \"X-Men\" films, as well as the 1981 animated series \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends.\" The \"X-Men\" series of comics have long been progressive in terms of diversity, with a black female character, Storm, appearing in the 1970s, and the first gay mainstream comic book character, Northstar (who later married in the pages). DC Comics has also had prominent gay characters in recent years, like Batwoman and the original Green Lantern of Earth 2. Catwoman recently came out as bisexual, and Harley Quinn is portrayed that way as well.

Paul Lambert was sacked by Aston Villa in February after two-and-a-half seasons at the club . \u2018There have been conversations with Villa regarding the future and I need to have a think about things in the summer,\u2019 Bent told the Daily Telegraph. \u2018I\u2019m not ruling out going back, just like I wouldn\u2019t rule out staying at Derby because they have given me a lifeline to play football and score goals again. We will have to look at it. \u2018A club that size should not have had the seasons we\u2019ve had for the last couple of seasons. I enjoyed the first few years but Paul Lambert came in and it all changed, it all went downhill for me from there. \u2018He made those decisions but ultimately he\u2019s not there any more and I think it was 100 per cent right, the best thing for the football club. Bent endured a frustrating time at Villa Park while Lambert was in charge as he was left on the sidelines . Tim Sherwood has inspired at mini-revival at Villa Park since taking over earlier this year . \u2018I know Tim Sherwood from Tottenham, he\u2019s an unbelievable motivator and it\u2019s the perfect job for him.\u2019 Bent, who has scored seven goals since going on loan to Derby, also praised Steve McClaren as one of the best managers he has played under. \u2018He\u2019s being linked with Sunderland and Newcastle and that shows you how good he is,\u2019 Bent added. \u2018Whether we get promoted or not, we\u2019ll definitely be trying to hold on to him this summer.

A biology teacher discovered the worms on the surface of the snow while he was skiing in the mountains near Bergen at the weekend.

Worm rainfall: Karstein Erstad took this photograph of the worms he discovered in the snow on Sunday . Teacher\u00a0Karstein Erstad told Norwegian news website The Local: 'When I found them on the snow they seemed to be dead, but when I put them in my hand I found that they were alive.' Initially he thought they had wiggled their way through the snow, but dismissed this when he realised it was up to a metre deep in some places.
